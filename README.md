# MarsRobots
This is a solution for the Martian Robots problem.

## List of Assumptions
* There are no "holes" in the grid. That means that a robot can go off only from the edge.
* Future commands that may be required, should be able to modify robot's position and status.
* After a robot goes off the grid, it's position is no longer updated.

## Estimates
It should take 8 hours to build the entire solution for a customer.
